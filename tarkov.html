                    <h2> - A realistic online FPS shooter game with MMO and survival elements.</h2>

                    <p>
                        In this game there is only survival or death. You can play as either a PMC which is your personal character, or as a Scav. 
                        Scav is a scavenger character with a random loadout. Whether or not playing as a PMC or a Scav, whatever loot you can grab you get to keep, that is IF you survive.
                        If you do not survive a raid, you lose everything you had with you. Going from rags to riches is every players goal.

                    <h2>"How are the guns in this game?"</h2>
                    <h2> -You can change EVERY part of EVERY gun to your liking. The modding in this game is insane. </h2>

                    <p>
                        In tarkov there are hundreds if not thousands of weapon parts. 
                        You can start a gun build from a pistol grip and go from there. 
                        You can change every single part of every single gun. It really still blows my mind how each and every weapon part 
                        really affects the gun. There some parts that increase the guns ergonomics. Ergonomics of a gun affect how quickly you
                        can aim down sights with your weapon. It also increases the duration of how long you can keep your gun up, before your arms get tired.
                        Another important stat is vertical recoil. The better the recoil, easier it is to shoot a target.

                    <h2>And there is so much more.. </h2>
                    <p>The sounds are key, different kinds of headphones make certain sounds lower and allow you to hear footsteps easier.
                        This goes hand to hand with map knowledge. If you are at a certain spot, and hear sounds from your right which are 
                        footsteps on a wooden floor it helps you out a tremendous amount if you're aware of what is there. Map knowledge allows
                        you to pinpoint down an exact location of your enemy. This game is fantastic in what it does, and I've never stumbled upon 
                        anything like this. I recommend this game to anyone even slightly interested. Playing this with your friends is a fun experience
                        and since there is no indicator on top of your friend in game, you need to know where he is at all times. Losing track of your friends movements
                        can be deadly. I've been in that situation many times, and asking "Is that you?" and getting gunned down isn't exactly ideal.
